This Python script automates the process of parsing .pdf invoices to extract the desired
information.
Ex. Given Invoice.pdf --> Total Amount Due: Â¥27,500

This script asks the user to enter the file path to their invoice file, and then extract critical
information like the Invoice #, date, due date, billed to, vendor, and total bill amount.

This script can be easily customized or scaled to parse folders of multiple invoice files or to
extract other information.

The Invoice.pdf file can be used to try this script out.
