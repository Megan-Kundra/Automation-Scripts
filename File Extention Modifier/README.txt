This Python script automates the process of changing file extension types. 
Ex. make all .txt files in the folder .md files.

In the command terminal the user will be prompted to enter the extension type they have,
and the extension type they want it to become. Users can also quit the script at any 
point if they wish. (current ext --> desired ext)

Currently you have to set the file path in the Python script file itself, but this can be easily 
modified to have the user give the folder's path in the terminal, along with the extension 
modifications they want to make.

For demonstration purposes, the script is running on all files in the test_files folder. If you
would like to try this script out on your own folder, simply replace the string for the folder_path
variable with your own folder path on line 4. Alternatively, if you just want to play around with
the script, you can run the script as is, or add other test files into the test_files folder.
