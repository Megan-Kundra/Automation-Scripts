This Python script automates the process of organizing FAQs and their answers into separate markdown
files.

This script asks the user to enter the file path to their complete FAQs .csv file, and then groups
the questions by subject so they can be saved together in relevant markdown files.

This script can be easily customized or scaled to utilize AI support tools and Advanced Natural
Language Processing (ANLP) to develop answers to FAQs when answers have not already been provided.

The faqs.csv file can be used to try this script out.
