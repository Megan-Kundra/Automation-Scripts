This Python script automates the process of reformatting lines of text in a file to a new length.
Ex. Changing the line length of a document from 50 to 100 characters long.

In the command terminal the user will be prompted to enter their desired line length, if no input is
given here the default line length of 100 characters will be used. Then users give their file path,
and have the option  to overwrite the current file or save the formatted file as a new file, users
can also quit the script at any point if they wish.
